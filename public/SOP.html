<h1>Statement Of Purpose</h1>
</hr>

<h3>In today’s world, modern technology is advancing rapidly. Automation systems are increasingly being implemented, driving more significant changes in the fields of science and technology.</h3>

<h3>When I think about university programs in the digital age, the Faculty of Master of Science Programme in Information Technology at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, comes to mind. This program combines knowledge in science, technology, design, creation, and development. It plays a crucial role in advancing science and technology.

<h3>Two years ago, I started searching for myself, trying to observe what I liked and what I was good at. I experimented with various things to get to know myself better. I began by observing those close to me, particularly my father. He works in computer engineering, focusing on software and hardware for automatic control systems in industrial settings. His work involves using technology to make computers or machines replicate repetitive tasks, reducing the number of people needed in the process. Computer commands assist in the operation. I became interested in my father’s line of work, which inspired me to start learning about the field. I asked him for advice on where to begin, and he said, “Try doing something related to this field yourself, and you’ll see if you can pursue it further.” I decided to start learning how to code, with my father as my mentor. I practiced basic commands using Python. This hands-on experience helped me better understand computer systems, and I applied this knowledge to further my learning. Eventually, I discovered website development—the process of designing and building websites for the internet. I studied HTML, CSS, and PHP to create my own website. I realized that building a website was not easy. I gave myself time to experiment, making mistakes, and learning from them until I gained a deeper understanding. Through practicing coding and gaining real experience, I discovered my passion and interest in computers, especially since I am also good at mathematics. This helped me make the decision to pursue the “Faculty of Information Technology, specializing in Information Technology.” I believe that in the future, technology will be integrated into various applications to create new innovations. My dream is to be one of the people who contributes to the world by creating new things through technology and my knowledge.

<h3>  I chose to study at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi because I had the opportunity to attend the 11th I-Dia Camp. This camp was organized by the Joint Program in Media Arts and Media Technology, under the Faculty of Architecture and Design, Media Technology Department, at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi. I was impressed by the atmosphere on campus, from the warm welcome of the security guards to the care and support provided by the camp mentors. I witnessed a great community, which made me want to become part of this university. Thus, I set my goal: “I must study at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi.”</h3>
